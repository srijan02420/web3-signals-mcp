## What It Is

A signal fusion engine that scores 20 crypto assets from 0-100 by combining 5 independent data agents:

| Agent | Weight | Sources |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Whale | 30% | On-chain flows, exchange movements, large transactions |
| Technical | 25% | RSI, MACD, Moving Averages (Binance) |
| Derivatives | 20% | Funding rate, open interest, long/short ratio |
| Narrative | 15% | Reddit, Google News, CoinGecko trending, LLM sentiment |
| Market | 10% | Price, volume, Fear & Greed Index |

Each agent runs every 15 minutes. Scores are fused into a composite signal with directional labels (`STRONG BUY` to `STRONG SELL`), momentum tracking, and LLM-generated cross-dimensional insights.

## What Problem It Solves

AI agents and trading systems need structured, multi-dimensional crypto intelligence — not raw price feeds. This API delivers scored, opinionated signals that combine what whales are doing, what derivatives markets are pricing, what the crowd is saying, and what technicals show — fused into a single actionable score with an LLM explanation of why.

## Target Horizon

- **Signal refresh**: Every 15 minutes
- **Accuracy evaluation**: 24h, 48h windows
- **Best for**: Swing trades (hours to days), portfolio risk monitoring, market regime detection
- **Not designed for**: Sub-minute scalping or HFT

## Assets Covered

`BTC` `ETH` `SOL` `BNB` `XRP` `ADA` `AVAX` `DOT` `MATIC` `LINK` `UNI` `ATOM` `LTC` `FIL` `NEAR` `APT` `ARB` `OP` `INJ` `SUI`

## Connect via MCP

Add to your MCP config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web3-signals": {
      "url": "https://web3-signals-api-production.up.railway.app/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your AI: *"What are the current crypto signals?"* or *"Get me the BTC signal"*

## Performance Tracking

The system tracks its own signal accuracy — no self-reported claims:

- **Snapshots** captured every 12 hours (1 per asset, max 40/day)
- **Evaluation** at 24h and 48h windows against actual price movement
- **Direction match**: Did the predicted direction (bullish/bearish/neutral) match the actual price move?
- **Neutral threshold**: Price move <=2% counts as correct for neutral signals
- **Price source**: CoinGecko (independent, no API key needed)
- **Window**: 30-day rolling, recalculated every evaluation cycle

## Discovery Protocols

| Protocol | Endpoint | Standard |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **x402** | `/signal`, `/signal/{asset}` | [HTTP 402 Micropayments](https://www.x402.org/) (Coinbase) |
| **MCP SSE** | `/mcp/sse` | [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (Anthropic) |
| **A2A** | `/.well-known/agent.json` | [Agent-to-Agent](https://google.github.io/A2A/) (Google) |
| **AGENTS.md** | `/.well-known/agents.md` | [Agentic AI Foundation](https://agenticaialliance.org/) |
| **OpenAPI** | `/docs` | OpenAPI 3.0 |

## x402 Micropayments

Payment IS authentication. No API keys, no signup, no OAuth.

AI agents pay $0.001 USDC per call on Base mainnet. The x402 protocol handles discovery, payment, and settlement automatically via the [Coinbase CDP Facilitator](https://x402.org/facilitator).

### Paid Endpoints ($0.001/call)
| Endpoint | What you get |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /signal` | All 20 signals + portfolio summary + LLM insights |
| `GET /signal/{asset}` | Single asset signal with 5 dimensions |
| `GET /performance/reputation` | 30-day rolling accuracy score |

### Free Endpoints
`/health`, `/dashboard`, `/analytics`, `/docs`, `/.well-known/*`, `/mcp/sse`

### How it works
1. Agent calls `GET /signal` → gets `402 Payment Required` with payment instructions
2. Agent signs USDC payment on Base → retries with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header
3. Facilitator verifies payment → endpoint returns data
4. Settlement happens on-chain in <2 seconds

Agents using x402-compatible clients (Otto, Questflow, Fluora, Oops!402) handle this automatically.

## Roadmap

### Near-term (building now)
- **Calibration buckets** — Group signals by score range (e.g. 70-80) and track accuracy per bucket. Answers: "When we say 75, how often is that actually bullish?" *(needs 24h+ of accuracy data)*
- **Magnitude scoring** — Move beyond binary hit/miss to measure how much the predicted move captured vs actual move. *(needs 1 week of data)*

### Medium-term
- **Confidence-weighted penalties** — Penalize high-conviction misses more than low-conviction ones. A "STRONG BUY" that dumps should hurt reputation more than a "MODERATE BUY" that goes flat. *(needs calibration data)*
- **Correlation vs BTC baseline** — Compare signal accuracy against a naive "just follow BTC" strategy. If we can't beat that, the signal isn't adding value. *(needs 30 days of data)*

### Future
- **x402 micropayments** — Pay-per-signal via HTTP 402
- **Additional assets** — Expand beyond 20
- **More data sources** — Twitter/X, Farcaster, CryptoPanic (currently disabled, pending API access)
